    <p>The MFAH campus unites the brilliant architectural and design work of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Isamu Noguchi, and Rafael Moneo, part of a 75-year legacy of inspired commissions that spans from 1924-and the construction of the original Museum building designed by William Ward Watkin in the Neoclassical style-to the year 2000, when the museum completed the Rafaiel Moneo-designed Audrey Jones Beck Building.</p>

    <h2>Alfred C. Glassell School of Art</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Architect Eugene Aubry of S. I,. Morris and Associates</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>Director: William C. Agee</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>Year: 1979</em></strong></p>
    <p>By the mid-1970s, the Musuem needed a new facility for its school of art to accommodate the growing student body. Under the guidance of Museum director William C. Agee, and with a generous donation from Alfred Glassell, Jr., a plan for an approximately 42,000-square-foot building was drawn up by architects Eugene Aubry and R. Nolen Willis of the prominent Houston firm S. I. Morris and Associates.  The building-a two-story space made from conctrete and glass-block, and located one block north of the Museum-represented the first time that the school had a home of its own in its 52-year history.  The Glassell School of Art opened to the public on January 13, 1979.</p>
